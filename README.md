# many_days
checks how many days are left till an target date. This does not work on dates that came before christ. It also accounts for leap years only after 1800 a.d. .As one can guess from statements made, this is the western calender. So 12 months and ,2024 a.d. as of now. 

# purpose/usage
Just copy the code and press run.
This is for the purpose if someone wants to look into the future and tell how many days left till an event for example. One can also use this to look the differences in days for specific dates though is limited to 1800 because of the leap years. Everything after that becomes inprecise. Also it generally does not work on b.c.
